# ImageTagging


This is the start of a personal project of mine.  The goal of this project is to use Amazon Rekognition (fed by pictures in S3 buckets) to detect labels and faces, and then store this information in Amazon RDS for later retrieveal and search in a front end applicaiton.  

I was tired of only being able to search my pictures by directory names, and wanted to use machine learning and Amazon Rekognition to create my personal image search engine.
